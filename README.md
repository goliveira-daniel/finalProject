# finalProject
Final project for the WMDD20 class at Langara
# Overview
The investment calculator enables users to compare between three famous fixed income investment bonds in Brazil: LCI, LCA and CDB. While the first and second are exempt from payment of income taxes, the CDB is taxed based on the duration of the investment, in a decreasing rate (see table below for more details). The return of those investments are commonly a percentage of an public index called CDI. Given the percentage of LCI and LCA bonds are different of the CDB, some math is required to find the equivalence of them.
# Goals
Calculate the equivalence between LCI, LCA and CDB bonds
Forecast the CDI index based on futures contracts signed at stock exchange
# Specifications
The project will have a website with a form, so the user can inform the type of product, duration and % of return of the products he/she wants to compare. A javascript script will calculate the equivalence of the bonds. Once calculated, the page will be display which product has the higher return %.
# Additional objective 
Through the below URL, try to forecast the CDI index for the future.
URL for future contracts negotiated on the stocks exchange:
